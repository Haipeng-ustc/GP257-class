    "1. Response: 2^31-1 is the maximum number that can be represented by the type of np.int32. After adding 1 on this large number, the overflow problem occurs and then the result becomes -2^31 due to wraparound effect, which is the minimum number that can be represented by this type. For the Python int32 number, this issue also occurs but Python implicitly adds one more bit length of the data type so that it can represent the larger number of 2^31. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Response:  Since there is no negative value in my operations, I would like to consider use the unsigned int32 or unsigned int64 to represent my values, which can double the range of the positive number compared with the original int32 or int64, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Response: Performing the addition to the indexed numpy variable lead to implicit data type casting from int32 to int64 when overflow problem occurs. But it seems that performing the same operaton on the whole Numpy array will not lead to any changes of the data type.\n",

An example of when you might encounter truncation errors is when solving integrals (a sequence of summations) on a computer. Given that we mostly work with computers that have finite precision arithematic, we must represent integrals as finite summations.\n",
