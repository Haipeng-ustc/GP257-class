    "Similary to the multicore parallelization lab, in this lab we will be using Numba and CuPy to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications using GPU. Accelerating the marrix-matrix multiplication operation is a good analog to accelerating other types of operators and computationally intense kernels, codes, and algorithms. Furthermore, the structure of matricies makes matrix-matrix multiplication a good place start learning how to parallelize code.\n",

    "### Exercise 2: Using Numba CUDA to parallelize matrix multiplication: \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use Numba compiled GPU kernels that calculate matrix-matrix multiplication for square matrices. In particular, we will use a GPU kernel that doesn't used shared memory and compared to a GPU kernel that does use shared-memory. Please use the two kernel codes discussed in the following lab: [NYU Numba CUDA Lab5](https://nyu-cds.github.io/python-numba/05-cuda/). As you will see in this exercise, learning to use shared-memory (akin to user-controlled cache), can take a lot of practice, so in the next exercise, we examine how well the simple shared-memory kernel from the NYU lab compares to the optimized codes provided by NVIDIA in the CuPy package. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The tasks for this exercise:\n",
    "1. Copy the matrix-matrix kernel codes from the NYU lab. Test them for accurracy against *numpy.dot()* and also compare time runtimes these GPU kernels the numpy.dot() function as well. **Note:** Use [CUDA events](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda-reference/host.html#events) when timing GPU kernel calls because the driver does not \"block\" the calling process (for case this is IPython). Insted, the kernel is sent to the GPU to run, and then the process (IPython) immediately continues to it's next bit of code. Contrary to GPU kernel calls, calls to copy data to or from the GPU will block the process. For these cases, the calls can be timed the same way that other Python calls are timed.<br> **For both GPU kernels:**\n",
    "    - Test with square Matrices: $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$. For the cases when $N = 5120$, $N=10240$, and $N=20480$. **Tip**, first make sure you can get the GPU codes to work and that you get correct results by testing with $N_{test}=32$.\n",
    "    - For each $N$ above, test the multiplication for both dtypes: *dtype=float32* and *dtype=float64*.\n",
    "    - Calculate and show the error between your functions and the *numpy.dot()* function. \n",
    "    - Calculate and show the *speedup* (or *slowdown*) of your GPU kernel for each $N$ vs *numpy.dot()*. Be sure to include the array copy times in the \"total-gpu-kernel runtime.\n",
    "    - For each $N$ vs, calculate and show the *speedup* of your GPU kernel using *dtype=float32* vs *dtype=float64*. Be sure to include the array copy times in the \"total-gpu-kernel runtime.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create your matrices using random numbers. An example is shown below (feel free to copy this).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h_A = np.random.random((N, N)).astype(np.<float-type>)\n",
    "h_B = np.random.random((N, N)).astype(np.<float-type>)\n",
    "```    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the device memory:\n",
    "    - Create **d_A** and **d_B** by copying **h_A** and **h_B** to the GPU, and be sure to time the copies\n",
    "    - Create **d_C** as device-array that is allocated on the GPU (device) only, and not on the host (**Do Not Copy**)\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the GPU matrix-matrix multiplication kernel finishes, **copy** the the *device-array* **d_C** to the *host-array* **h_C**, and be sure to time this copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Discuss your results in the markdown cell that follows your codes include in your discussion remarks about the speedup or slowdowns vs numpy as well as float32 vs float64. Remember, that your runtime for the GPU kernel include time to compile the kernel (not much you can do to control this). Futhermore, becasue you have to copy data to and off of the GPU, these copy times should be included in the \"total-gpu-kernel runtime.\" "

In calculating the time of the GPU kernel, the array copy times are included in the \"total-gpu-kernel runtime.\" I suspect that the slow speed of the GPU is possibly due to the fact that copying data to and off of the GPU is slow. It should be also noted that the I first tested the GPU kernel with N = 32 before running the large cases, to test the correctness of the GPU kernel and also compile the code for the first time.\n",

In general, the GPU version with shared memory is faster, which is more obvious when N is large.\n",

However, we will use *CuPy* functions, which are similar to *Numpy* funcstions with some added functions for copying data to-the-device-from-the-host and to-the-host-from-the-device. By using CuPy, we can depend on code that has been optimized for the GPU by NVIDIA, and instead of tyring to optimize our matrix-matrix multiplication kernels, we can use a built-in function to calculate the multiplication instead (i.e. [cupy.dot()](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupy.dot.html#cupy.dot)).\n",

You will **not** need to declare the deive-C array before calling *cupy.dot()* because the function will do it for you (like numpy does).\n"

The results show that the matrix wrap time from numpy array to device array is larger then that from deive array to cupy array. The reason for that, I think, is that the former needs to copy the data from the host to the device, while the latter only needs to copy the data from the device to the device.\n",
