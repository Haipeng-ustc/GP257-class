# GPU_Parallelization_of_Matrix-Matrix_Multiplication

Using GPUs in Python

## Getting started

* You need to request a *T4* node on the cluster. Don't forget that you need to add **--gres=gpu** to your srun command.
* Reminder: on the *T4* nodes you need to load a different version of Python:
```bash
spack load python@3.10.7
```
