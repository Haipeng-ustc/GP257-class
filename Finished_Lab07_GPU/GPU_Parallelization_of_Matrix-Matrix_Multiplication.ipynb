Copy the matrix-matrix kernel codes from the NYU lab.

Insted, the kernel is sent to the GPU to run, and then the process (IPython) immediately continues to it's next bit of code. Contrary to GPU kernel calls, calls to copy data to or from the GPU will block the process. For these cases, the calls can be timed the same way that other Python calls are timed.<br> **For both GPU kernels:**\n","    - Test with square Matrices: $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$. For the cases when $N = 5120$, $N=10240$, and $N=20480$. **Tip**, first make sure you can get the GPU codes to work and that you get correct results by testing with $N_{test}=32$.\n","    - For each $N$ above, test the multiplication for both dtypes: *dtype=float32* and *dtype=float64*.\n","    - Calculate and show the error between your functions and the *numpy.dot()* function.\n","    - Calculate and show the *speedup* (or *slowdown*) of your GPU kernel for each $N$ vs *numpy.dot()*.

The speedup using GPU compared is about 4~8 times faster than the numpy.dot() function in different cases. The speedup is more obvious when N is large. In calculating the time of the GPU kernel, the array copy times are included in the \"total-gpu-kernel runtime.\" I suspect that the most time of the GPU code is possibly copying data to and off of the GPU. It should be also noted that the I first tested the GPU kernel with N = 32 before running the large cases, to test the correctness of the GPU kernel with **benchmark=True** and also compile the code for the first time. The relative errors for all cases are all very small.\n","\n","When using the shared memory, the GPU version code is faster than the original GPU version without using the shared memory in most cases.

In general, the GPU version with shared memory is faster, which is more obvious when N is large.\n","\n","In terms of the data type, the computation on the float32 is faster than the computation on the float64, and the latter takes double computation time of the former in most cases.
