    "## Multicore Parallelization of Matrix Multiplication Using Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be using Numba to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications by exploiting parallelism. Even most laptops today have Multicore CPUs, where a *core* is a microprocessor, and each core is usually a copy of the each other core. Accelerating the marrix-matrix multiplication operation is a good analog to accelerating other types of operators and computationally intense kernels, codes, and algorithms. Furthermore, the structure of matricies makes matrix-matrix multiplication a good place start learning how to parallelize code.\n",

To time the np.dot() function, you can wrap it in another function and use the *mytimer* wrapper; however, please copy the code for testing the A and B dimensions into your function wrapper for the np.dot() function.

    "### Exercise 2: Using Numba to speed up matrix multiplication: \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, numba to speedup our matrx-matrix multiplication function below. However, there is an interesting twist to this exercise. We will write six versions of the naive function you wrote above. One function for each of the six possible permutations of three loops used to calculate the multplication (i.e. ijk, ikj, jik, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The tasks for this exercise:\n",
    "1. Make six copies your code for the my_naive_matmul(), one copy for each of the possible permutations and define them in the cell bellow:\n",
    "    - One of these function will have the same loop order as the my_naive_matmul() function. \n",
    "    - However name these functions: numba_mul_\\<perm\\>(), where \\<perm\\> should be replaced by the specific loop order of the function.\n",
    "2. In the cell that follows your function definitions, test and compare the accuracy and runtime of your functions against the numpy.dot() function.\n",
    "    - Test with a square Matrices: $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$. For the cases when $N = 128, 256,$ and $512$.\n",
    "    - For each matrix set their dtype as: dtype=np.float64\n",
    "    - Calculate and show the error between your functions and the numpy.dot() function. (Same as in Exercise 1.)\n",
    "    - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest function has versus the all the other functions.\n",
    "    - You should notice that one of your permutation functions is faster than the others. For this case show the following:\n",
    "        - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest permutation function has versus the my_naive_matmul().\n",
    "        - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest permutation function has when $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all of dtype=np.float64 vs all are of dtype=np.float32.\n",
    "3. Create your matrices using random numbers. (Same as in Exercise 1.) \n",
    "4. For each function, you need to add a function decorator for numba. Numba will *JIT* the function (**J**ust **I**n **T**ime compilation). \n",
    "    - Use the flag to keep a \"cache\" of the compiled code (not to be confused with CPU cache). **Note**: to get accurate timings, you will need to run your tests **twice**, because during the first run, the code is compiled and this compile time will be included in your runtime. After the first run, the compiled binary will be stored, so consecutive runs will be faster.\n",
    "    - Use the flag to use *fast math*\n",
    "    - Use the flag to disable the Python Global Interpretor Lock (GIL).\n",
    "    - The code below should get you started, but it is incomplete.\n",
